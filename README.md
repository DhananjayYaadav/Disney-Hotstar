## Disney Character Game

Create a dynamic web page using JavaScript which will allow the user to play a game to randomly select a Disney character, and for a short biography of that character to appear on the page.

-   A Disney character should be randomly selected when the user clicks a button on screen to play the game.
-   Information about the character should also display on the page,
    -   For example: name, image of character, movie(s) they are in, friend or nemesis, song they may sing, quote they are known for, etc.
    -   This information should be displayed below the button and styled up using CSS.
    -   You may add additional biographical information if you wish.
    -   Your chosen characters can be a selection of Disney characters or they can all be from the same movie, especially if you have a favourite Disney film.

### Requirements

1. It is preferred to enter the JavaScript code in an External JS file instead of embedding the code in the HTML.
2. All HTML content must be marked up using HTML5.
3. Addressing to resources (e.g. Images) must use relative addressing.
4. Pages must be **HTML5 compliant**. Validate your pages with http://validator.w3.org.
5. CSS should be added using External Stylesheets as in the previous assignment.
